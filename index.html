				<h4>My background</h4>
				<p>I don't have much experience with coding, I took a few classes through pcc, that's about it. I decided to enroll in Epicodus because the classes I did take through pcc intrigued me and I wanted to learn more! I plan on putting all my focus on <span style="color: red">Epicodus</span> and learning as much as I can to be successful in my future.<strong>I am so excided!</strong>
